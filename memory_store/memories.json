It provides a foundational understanding of computing architectures, hardware-software co-design, and the limitations of silicon and interconnects—key topics for designing efficient, energy-aware AI infrastructure. In contrast, ECE-GY 6143 focuses on machine learning algorithms and is more aligned with AI model development than low-level system design.\n\nPersonal note: Given your goal in AI infrastructure, ECE-GY 6913 will better prepare you for system-level challenges in hardware and architecture.",
