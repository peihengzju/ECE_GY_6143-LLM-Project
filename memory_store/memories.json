It covers foundational computing architectures, RISC-V (critical for embedded and low-level systems), and hardware efficiency—directly aligning with your interest in embedded systems, AI infrastructure, and chip design. This course builds the hardware-software foundation you need before diving into VLSI or ASIC design.",
